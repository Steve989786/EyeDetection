# How To Run
1. Copy pretrained Neural Network model 'PatternNet.mat' file in the folder where you are running this script.
2. Run 'main.m' file.

Note:
If you want to regenerate and retrain Neural Network model, then download training data i.e. 'Train/' from 'https://github.com/chetanborse007/EyeDetection' and copy 'Train/' folder to the location where you are running this script.


# TODO
Write appropriate README.
